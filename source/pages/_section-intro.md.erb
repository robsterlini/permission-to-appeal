London-based *Permission To Appeal*, was formed in 2014, and prides itself on undertaking performances at a range of different functions, from background mood-music, through affecting ballads, to up-front and lively.

The various members of the sextet have a range of different musical backgrounds but are united in their love of jazz in so many of its forms: trad, big-band, be-bop and even funk, some popular and well known, others more obscure, but all chosen with care to reflect the character of the band.  
The numbers that the band present will be instantly recognisable in form and sound, but will also be rendered quite individual through inventive – not to mention entertaining – improvisation.

*Permission To Appeal* is very happy to play at your event – just contact us for a chat, and we’ll sort it all out for you.
Nice!
