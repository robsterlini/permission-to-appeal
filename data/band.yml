band:

  ## MIKE
  - name: "Mike Roberts"
    copy:
      - "Growing up in deepest, darkest Portsmouth, Mike learned nothing about jazz in his youth, opting instead for healthy doses of classical music and good old rock’n’roll. Having had enough of the fresh sea air, he moved to London to see what all the fuss was about. Picking up a law degree in the process, Mike became a regular player in the jazz scene and claims to hold the record for most number of times escorted off stage at Ronnie Scott’s. He is fast running out of disguises. Mike is now a Clinical Negligence Solicitor at Leigh Day and, along with nearly everyone else in the band, is one of the founding members of Permission to Appeal. When asked why he chose trumpet, Mike replies “Well, it only has three buttons so I thought it’d be easy”. How wrong he was."

  ## CHRIS ESDAILE
  - name: "Chris Esdaile"
    copy:
      - "Chris’ eclectic musical career focussed initially on choral singing - he has sung in choirs in the UK (including Westminster Abbey Special Choir as a boy treble), and whilst living in South Africa and Chile, and he set up and conducted a choir whilst at at University. He spent 10 years as part of world music group Kopanang, performing for radio, TV and at festivals in the UK and in Europe. With Kopanang, he developed his percussion playing (including djembe), and whilst in Chile he learnt to play the charango (South American mini guitar).  He has composed and arranged music for choirs, and produced a CD of his own jazz-tinged ambient electronic music in 2003."

  ## PETER
  - name: "Peter Hopper"
    nickname: "Peter “PJ” Hopper"
    copy:
      - "Born not long before the 80s struck, PJ grew up the son of a musical preacher man in the wilds of North Eastern England. Always hankering for his dad’s guitar, he got his own at the age of six, and began his musical journey. Picking up the bass at fifteen, he and his friends (including his now brother-in-law) formed a band, eventually to be called go-carter, which would bring them all to London five years later.  Since the break-up of that band, PJ has worked mostly as a singer songwriter, and later with vocalist Miles Elliot. By day he works in legal accounts at Leigh Day and he gives his pastimes as rugby (King’s Cross Steelers RFC) and talking to strangers."

  ## LUIGI
  - name: "Luigi Sterlini"
    copy:
      - "Dyed-in-the-wool Londoner (of Italian extraction) Luigi has been playing alto sax since 2007. He plays in other bands, including his very regular, long-term group <em>Eat The Lemon</em>, and 10-piece occasional pop outfit <em>The Power of Ten</em>, in which he occupies the guitar-playing slot. Asked why Luigi has chosen also to play jazz saxophone – currently a Selmer Mark III - he replies: “It’s the very sound of the human voice and the very sound of a person’s soul”. Nice!"

  ## LEILA
  - name: "Leila Grove"
    copy:
      - "A member of a large musical family, Leila began playing flute and piano from a young age, before learning to sing as both a soloist and as part of a choir. Since leaving university, where she performed in a <em>baroque pop</em> band, she has enjoyed singing in the Gray’s Inn chapel choir and her family band <em>The Mutineers</em>."
      - "Although Leila was relatively new to the vocal jazz style, she quickly fell in love. “At first it felt like breaking the rules, but then I realised that’s half the fun!”"
